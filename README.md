# immunizationtracker
## This project aims at tracking immunization defaulters at Kakamega County.

The immunization schedule for infants is a key aspect of sustainable healthcare
in Kakamega County. Therefore, these infants need to go by the schedule until 
completion. Here is a case whereby a child received his Penta1 in January but 
did not return for Penta2 in February. Upon receiving his Penta1 in January, 
his card is moved to February, when Penta2 is due. Unfortunately in February 
he did not return for Penta2 and his card was not moved to March. 

Knowing if a child has completed the immunization is difficult in cases where 
the immunization card was not documented. In cases where the child completes 
the started immunization in next facility, he is recorded as a defaulter in 
the primary facility. How can we find a way of locating this child to ensure 
he completes the schedule and is not recorded as a defaulter?
